# Data characteristics

- High-dimensional
- Compositional
- Zero-inflated
- Multivariate
- Unequal sequencing depth
- Over-dispersion

---

# Aims

- Provide pratical advice for choice of method
- Evalute methods with respect to
  -- different data characteristics
  -- different taxonomic levels


---

# Data-generating mechanisms

- true data-generating mechanism unknown
- simulation based on probability model may not represent true data structure
- possible solution:
      - resampling from a large set of samples taken from healthy subjects
      - induce effects on top of resampling dataset using probability model
- comes with drawbacks
      - "spurious" effects due to resampling
      - effect of interest will be a combinations of "true" effect and noise in the data
- Data characteristics may vary with taxonomic depth
      - lower ranks:
            - dimensionality
            - zero-inflation
            - over-dispersion
      - higher ranks:
            - compositionality
